# AmongUs-Pt.-2----Detection-in-Player-Networks
This project involves creating a system that manages and analyzes a network of players and their relationships. The primary focus is to identify "imposters" based on the player's secret data and to explore the trust paths between players. The program includes functionality for detecting duplicate usernames, checking if a player has been visited in a traversal, identifying imposters by analyzing secret strings, and calculating paths of trust within the network of players. It can also detect cycles in the network's traversal paths. Additionally, the project defines methods for handling file input, organizing player data, and evaluating the shortest paths based on trust levels between friends.
